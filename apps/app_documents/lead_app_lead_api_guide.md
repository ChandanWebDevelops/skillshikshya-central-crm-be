### Lead Score (computed, never writable)

`lead_score` is automatically computed whenever the lead is updated. Newly created leads start at `0` — the score is calculated once the lead has a status, priority, or related records (calls, activities, followups). Formula:

| Factor | Max Points | Details |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Status progress | 35 | `(status.sort_order / max_non_final_order) * 35` |
| Priority | 25 | sort_order 1=25, 2=17, 3=9, 4=3 |
| Recency of contact | 20 | Last contact: ≤3d=20, ≤7d=15, ≤14d=10, ≤30d=5 |
| Engagement | 15 | `min(15, calls*3 + activities*1)` |
| Pending followup | 5 | Has at least one pending followup with future date |
| **Converted** | 100 | Fixed at 100 |
| **Final status** | 0 | Status with `is_final=true` resets to 0 |

Total clamped to 0–100. New leads start at 0; score updates on the next `PATCH` or when a call/activity/followup is added.

See [Notifications API Guide](lead_app_notifications_api_guide.md) for reading/clearing notifications.
