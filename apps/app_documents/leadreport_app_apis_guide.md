# Lead Reports App — API Guide

## Overview

The **Lead Reports** app aggregates CRM data across leads, enrollments, payments, follow-ups, and counselors into ready-to-use report payloads for dashboards and analytics.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8188`

All report endpoints are `GET` and require authentication (JWT cookie). Reports are **read-only** — no mutations.

### Common Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `start_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Lower bound for the report window (per-report date field). |
| `end_date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Upper bound for the report window. `start_date` must be ≤ `end_date`. |
| `branch_id` | `int` | **Staff only.** Restrict the report to one branch. |
| … | — | Each report also accepts lead dimension filters (see below). |

### Branch Scoping

Identical to the rest of the CRM (see [Lead App Overview](lead_app_overview.md#branch-scoping)):

| User type | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Staff / Superuser** | All branches. Pass `?branch_id=X` to scope to one branch. |
| **Non-staff with branch** | Automatically scoped to their assigned branch. |
| **Non-staff without branch** | All data (no restriction). |

### Lead Dimension Filters (apply to lead-based reports)

| Parameter | Applies to |
|-----------|------------|
| `status` | lead `status` FK id |
| `source` | lead `source` FK id |
| `campaign` | lead `campaign` FK id |
| `lead_type` | lead `lead_type` FK id |
| `priority` | lead `priority` FK id |
| `assigned_counselor` | lead `assigned_counselor` user id |
| `primary_course` | lead `primary_course` FK id |
| `is_converted` | `true` / `false` |
| `is_archived` | `true` / `false` |

## `GET /api/reports/`

Lists the available report names.

```json
{
  "available_reports": [
    "overview", "leads-by-status", "leads-by-source", "leads-by-type",
    "leads-by-branch", "leads-by-campaign", "leads-by-counselor",
    "lead-trend", "revenue", "enrollments", "conversion",
    "counselor-performance"
  ]
}
```

## `GET /api/reports/overview/`

Summary snapshot. `start_date` / `end_date` bound the `new_in_range`, `converted_in_range`, enrollment and revenue figures; `total` and `converted_total` are all-time within the same lead filters.

```json
{
  "date_range": { "start_date": "2026-08-01", "end_date": "2026-08-20" },
  "leads": {
    "total": 120, "new_in_range": 45, "converted_total": 18,
    "converted_in_range": 7, "conversion_rate": 15.0,
    "archived": 3, "lost": 9
  },
  "pipeline": {
    "active_leads": 117, "expected_revenue": "2350000.00"
  },
  "enrollments": {
